# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Calculation Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers corrected versions.

The primary issues highlighted are:

1. **Inconsistent Unit Usage:** Mixing different units within a `calc()` expression can lead to unexpected rendering.
2. **Complex Expressions:**  Very complex nested calculations may cause inconsistent behavior across browsers.

Understanding these issues is crucial for writing robust and cross-browser compatible CSS.
