The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some uncommon issues that can occur, such as incorrect operator precedence or unexpected behavior with units.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but mixing units inconsistently (like `width: calc(100% - 20em);`) can lead to unexpected results.  Another potential problem lies in using `calc()` with nested expressions or very complex calculations.  Browsers may handle them differently, resulting in inconsistencies across platforms or versions.
